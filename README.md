# NeuralNetwork
We will classify many breast cancer diagnosis as benign or malignant according to several features related with the external appearance of the tumours. For that purpose it will be used a machine learning algorithm, in particular a neural network with one hidden layer. This code was created from the one given in Deep Learning specialization in Coursera learning platform.
